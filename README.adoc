== Overview

Four VM cluster based on https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/docker[Vagrant running a docker container].

This project is essentially a testbed for testing containers produced by my https://github.com/bobspiller/vagrant-docker[vagrant-docker project].  
It will use the https://github.com/bobspiller/vagrant-docker/tree/master/centos-7[centos-vagrant:7] image by default.
Alternate images can be used by passing a `VAGRANT_IMAGE` invironment to the `vagrant up` command, for example:

----
$ VAGRANT_IMAGE=rockyos-vagrant:9.1
----

NOTE: Running this project with the https://github.com/bobspiller/vagrant-docker/tree/master/rocky-linux-9[rockyos-vagrant:9.1] image is still a Work In Progress

Using Vagrant to manage a cluster of VM-like containers has some advantages including having full control over:

* hostname
* vm IP address
* sshd host-port mapping
